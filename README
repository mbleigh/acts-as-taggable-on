ActsAsTaggableOn
================

This plugin is heavily based on Acts as Taggable on Steroids by Jonathan Viney. While
basic tagging functionality is handled expertly as well as tag cloud calculations, for
many applications there may be a need to have several "tag fields" for a given model.

For instance, in a social network, a user might have tags that are called skills,
interests, sports, and more. There is no real way to differentiate between tags and
so an implementation of this type is not possible with acts as taggable on steroids.

Enter Acts as Taggable On. Rather than tying functionality to a specific keyword
(namely "tags"), acts as taggable on allows you to specify an arbitrary number of
tag "contexts" that can be used locally or in combination in the same way steroids
was used.

Installation
============

The simplest way is just to install straight from the SVN:

script/plugin install http://svn.intridea.com/svn/public/acts_as_taggable_on

Testing
=======

Acts As Taggable On uses RSpec for its test coverage. If you already have RSpec on your
application, the specs will run while using:

rake spec:plugins

Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_taggable_on :tags, :skills, :interests
end

@user = User.new(:name => "Bobby")
@user.tag_list = "awesome, slick, hefty"      # this should be familiar
@user.skill_list = "joking, clowning, boxing" # but you can do it for any context!
@user.skill_list # => ["joking","clowning","boxing"] as TagList
@user.save

@user.tags # => [<Tag name:"awesome">,<Tag name:"slick">,<Tag name:"hefty">]
@user.skills # => [<Tag name:"joking">,<Tag name:"clowning">,<Tag name:"boxing">]

User.find_tagged_with("awesome", :on => :tags) # => [@user]
User.find_tagged_with("awesome", :on => :skills) # => []

@frankie = User.create(:name => "Frankie", :skill_list => "joking, flying, eating")
User.skill_counts # => [<Tag name="joking" count=2>,<Tag name="clowning" count=1>...]
@frankie.skill_counts

Relationships
====================

You can find objects of the same type based on similar tags on certain contexts.
Also, objects will be returned in descending order based on the total number of 
matched tags.

@bobby = User.new(:name => "Bobby")
@bobby.skill_list = "jogging, diving"

@frankie = User.new(:name => "Frankie")
@frankie.skill_list = "hacking"

@tom = User.new(:name => "Tom")
@tom.skill_list = "hacking, jogging, diving"

@tom.find_related_skills # => [<User name="Bobby">,<User name="Frankie">]
@bobby.find_related_skills # => [<User name="Tom">] 
@frankie.find_related_skills # => [<User name="Tom">] 


Dynamic Tag Contexts
====================

In addition to the generated tag contexts in the definition, it is also possible
to allow for dynamic tag contexts (this could be user generated tag contexts!)

@user = User.new(:name => "Bobby")
@user.set_tag_list_on(:customs, "same, as, tag, list")
@user.tag_list_on(:customs) # => ["same","as","tag","list"]
@user.save
@user.tags_on(:customs) # => [<Tag name='same'>,...]
@user.tag_counts_on(:customs)
User.find_tagged_with("same", :on => :customs) # => [@user]

Caveats, Uncharted Waters
=========================

This plugin is still under active development. Tag caching has not 
been thoroughly (or even casually) tested and may not work as expected.
